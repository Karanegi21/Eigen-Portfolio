Project Title: Eigen Portfolio Construction and Backtesting Using PCA in Machine Learning

Description:

Developed and implemented an Eigen Portfolio construction methodology using eigen vectors derived from Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on historical financial data.
Designed a backtesting framework to evaluate portfolio performance across various market conditions.
Key Achievements:

Applied PCA to reduce dimensionality and identify principal components explaining asset return variance.
Constructed an optimized Eigen Portfolio leveraging eigen vectors as weights, enhancing diversification and risk management.
Implemented backtesting strategies to assess portfolio performance metrics including Sharpe ratio, cumulative returns, volatility, and maximum drawdown.
Visualized and reported portfolio performance insights using Matplotlib, demonstrating [X]% improvement in [metric] compared to traditional methods.
Technologies Used:
Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook

Skills Demonstrated:

Expertise in quantitative finance concepts, including portfolio theory, PCA, and backtesting methodologies.
Proficient in data preprocessing, statistical modeling, and visualization for financial data analysis.
Ability to translate complex theories into practical applications for optimizing investment strategies.
Conclusion:

Successfully integrated advanced statistical techniques with machine learning to optimize portfolio construction and enhance investment decision-making processes.
Contributed to improving portfolio performance metrics through rigorous analysis and methodology refinement.
